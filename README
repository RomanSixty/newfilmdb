This project is a custom built movie database for my collection. I started out using MondoDB as database backend but found that using a technology I don't use in everyday work didn't help my motivation in implementing features. Therefore I switched to SQLite.

Features:

  * movie data (title, genres, ratings, cast, director, plot outline, poster)
    is pulled from IMDb (http://www.imdb.com)
  * gallery view of movie posters to browse the collection
  * detailed view in right sidebar
  * text search and filter options (by genre, actor, director, language)

Requirements (contained in this repository):

  * jQuery (http://jquery.com/) for some AJAX stuff
  * jQuery Lazy Load Plugin (http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload) for
    loading movie posters only when in viewport

Other requirements (not contained):

  * IMDBPHP2 (http://projects.izzysoft.de/trac/imdbphp/) as IMDb data scraper,
    configured as submodule in directory "imdbphp/"
  * PECL::intl (for correct utf82ascii-transliterations)
